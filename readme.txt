This project save data in localStorage.
It is mean that site can save information about file and about users(registration work but with LS) in LS your browser.
When You will registrate/download file its just save information in LS you can see and change this information.
I use LS for simulate back-end.
LS doesnt work in IE if you run index.html from file system your computer.
Thanks!
